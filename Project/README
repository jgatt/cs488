The final executable was compiled on this machine: gl06 

How to invoke my program: ./rt

Command Line Arguments: argv[1] specifies a lua model to open, default is 'scene.lua'

My program assumes that the lua files are all in the same directory. Therefore, to run any of the more interesting scenes the executable should be located in the same folder as the lua files (the data folder). 

My extra feature: reflection.  Image simple_cows_noreflection.png provided to demonstrate the difference.  

I did not implement the Sphere/Cube primitives, so any scenes (such as hier.lua) that require them will not work.

My scene is the scene shown in screenshot001, and can be generated by running scene.lua.  It is a collection of cows facing a mickey mouse model.  It is otherwise known as cow_cult.png, which is located in the data folder.

I only used models provided.
