Graphics - cs488
=====

Project work for uwaterloo class cs488 (introduction to computer graphics).

Started with basic work (making tetris, implementing the 'graphics pipeline,' etc.) but ended with a fairly substantial ray tracer!  Due to the relative short amount of time for each project (2 weeks maximum) the code isn't as nicely written as I would like, and I can't fix it as the libraries don't work on my computer >_>.

The final ray tracer was able to procure some pretty cool photos! Small gallery below (more complete work located at: http://jasonmgatt.blogspot.ca/2014/07/cs488-project.html).
